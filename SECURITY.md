# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing [security@example.com]. Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized using custom security utilities
- XSS prevention through input filtering and output encoding
- SQL/NoSQL injection prevention through parameterized queries and input validation

### 2. Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME type sniffing
- Referrer Policy for privacy protection
- X-XSS-Protection for legacy browser support

### 3. Environment Security
- Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Environment files excluded from version control

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Built-in rate limiting utilities to prevent abuse
- Configurable request limits per time window

### 5. CSRF Protection
- Secure token generation for CSRF protection
- Proper session management

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens) to version control
2. Use environment variables for all configuration
3. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
4. Keep dependencies updated
5. Follow the principle of least privilege

### For Deployment
1. Use HTTPS in production
2. Configure proper security headers
3. Regular security audits and dependency updates
4. Monitor for suspicious activities
5. Implement proper logging and monitoring
